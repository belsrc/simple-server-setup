# Simple server setup

To keep from having to bounce between a large number of sites to get the information, I consolidated it. This is mainly for myself but if someone else will find it useful, all the better. If you happen to notice something that is missing or configured wrong please let me know, you never stop learning.

  * `/guides` contains various guides to follow.
  * `/configs` contains configuration file examples that may be used if not present.
  * `/crons` contains the cron file and related scripts that I find useful.
  * `/scripts` contains any other useful script.
